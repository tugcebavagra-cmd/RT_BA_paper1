## Overview

Real-time aerial mapping requires accurate camera orientations to be estimated while the UAV is still in flight.

This becomes particularly challenging for **ultra-high-resolution UAV imagery**, where feature extraction, feature matching, and bundle adjustment can become computationally expensive.

Conventional approaches often address this problem by:

- downsampling the imagery,
- limiting the number of features,
- processing images offline, or
- relying heavily on GNSS/IMU navigation without image-based correction.

These strategies can reduce computational cost, but they may also sacrifice image information or fail to correct accumulated navigation errors.

This project presents a lightweight **real-time Bundle Adjustment (BA) framework** that operates directly on full-resolution UAV imagery without downsampling.

The method combines:

- adaptive patch-based feature tracking,
- UAV GNSS/IMU navigation,
- image-footprint projection,
- a coarse Digital Surface Model (DSM),
- patch-constrained feature matching, and
- localized bundle adjustment over overlapping image clusters.

The framework is designed for integration into the **DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS)** and targets time-critical applications such as disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection.

## Key Idea

The central idea is simple:

> **Use navigation and coarse terrain information to predict where image features should appear, then perform bundle adjustment only where it is needed.**

Instead of searching for correspondences across entire 50 MP images, each image is divided into smaller patches.

The patches are spatially propagated between images using available GNSS/IMU information and terrain-aware footprint projection.

Only corresponding patch regions are searched for features.

The resulting correspondences are then used by a localized bundle adjustment operating on a sliding cluster of overlapping images.
